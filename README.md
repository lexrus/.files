# My dotfiles inside $HOME folder

A repo to sync the CLI environment of my Mac(s).

I update these files to suit my daily work.

They might not please yours.

Usually they work smoothly every time I bought a shinny new Mac.

Any update shall follow these simple rules:

> - Efficieny over fancy
> - Capability over compatibility
> - Tools not used for a season better to be deleted or replaced

- [x] macOS
- [x] fish shell
- [x] vim
